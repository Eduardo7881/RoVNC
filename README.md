# RoVNC
My try to create a Roblox VNC Client using ScreenGui's and Frames.

# I think i'm the first person doing that (29/04/2025)

# My goal
- In Roblox we'll have a 100x100 screen grid for rendering. (I'LL CHANGE LATER)
- Every pixel is a FRAME with colors.
- My real goal is make it really work, for now, we are just testing with random pixels
